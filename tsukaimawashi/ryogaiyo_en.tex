      \small{The Kumano Dormitory self-government association has made the difficult decision to raise the maintenance fees (dormitory fees) due to the financial instability caused by unjust interference from Kyoto University.
      
      The Kumano Dormitory self-government association will demand that the university employ all cafeteria cooks and pay the full wages of all kitchen staff as before, in order to reduce the financial burden on students.
      
      Due to Kyoto University's policy since 1979 of not paying (refusing to employ) the wages of cafeteria cooks, dormitory residents have been unfairly bearing these personnel expenses, making dormitory management difficult. In the summer of 2021, pressure from Kyoto University led to the forced termination of the contract for vending machines inside the dormitory, worsening the financial situation. These vending machines, installed by the self-government association of Kumano Dormitory since 2008, were not for profit but to enhance resident welfare. All prices were below 100 yen, offering economic and convenient benefits to residents, with revenue contributing back to their welfare. Due to the long-term burden of cafeteria personnel costs and the forced vending machine contract termination, the self-government association had to raise maintenance fees.

      \noindent (Note) Regarding the agreement between Kyoto University and the Kumano Dormitory self-government association
  
      The current promise made between Vice President Hirashima, in charge of student affairs, and the Kumano Dormitory self-government association acknowledges "the fact that the university previously reduced the cafeteria labor force" and "the desire for all internal laborers to be employed by the university, with efforts made to improve their working environment and conditions." (See the full text of the promise on the pamphlet page referenced here.)}
